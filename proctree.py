"""Process-tree-safe subprocess dispatch.

`run_tree` is `subprocess.run` that kills the WHOLE process tree on timeout, not
just the direct child. Extracted from watch.py (fable-audit round-5 #2) so the
long-lived watcher AND the /api/ingest + /api/media/{id}/reingest HTTP routes share
one implementation: those routes used plain `subprocess.run(timeout=)`, which on
timeout kills only `ingest.py` and orphans its ffmpeg/whisper grandchildren — they
keep running (and, mid-encode, keep writing) with the H3 ingest slot already
released (audit H8, deferred #12).

POSIX: the child gets its own session (`start_new_session`) and the timeout path
`killpg`s the group. Windows: a new process group + `taskkill /T /F`.

    large to catch anything wedged. Splitting them lets each be right:

      stall_timeout  bounds how long the child may stay SILENT.
      total_timeout  bounds the whole run, as a backstop for a bad estimate.

    stdout and stderr are merged so that any byte counts as liveness — ingest.py
    flushes a marker at every stage (`probe`/`transcribe`/`thumbnail`/`frames`/
    `vision`), so silence really does mean "not progressing" rather than "buffered".

    `on_line(str)` is called for each line as it arrives (used to broadcast live
    progress); exceptions from it are swallowed so a bad consumer cannot kill the
